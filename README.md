Use the makefile with the following commands : `make` to create the executable `./exec` to run the program make clean to delete temporary files
In the event of an error, you can use the classic compilation command `gcc -o my_program main.c lib/utils.c lib/map.c lib/tile.c lib/game.c`
It doesn't need any special extention except for a C code runner and all the files contained in lib's folder, include's folder and main.c.
